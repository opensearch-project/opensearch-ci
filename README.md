## OpenSearch Continous Integration

OpenSearch Continous Integration is an open source CI system for OpenSearch and its plugins.

## Getting Started

- Requires [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install) to be installed
- Install project dependencies using `npm install` from this project directory
- Configure [aws credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites)
- Deploy stacks with `npm run cdk deploy`

## Deployment

### Dev Deployment 
1. Setup your local machine to credentials to deploy to the AWS Account
2. Deploy the ci-config-stack, `npm run cdk deploy CI-Config-Dev`, takes ~1 minute to deploy
3. [Optional](#ssl-configuration) Configure the elements of the config stack for SSL configuration `npm run cdk deploy CI-Dev -- --parameters useSsl=true`
4. [Optional](#setup-openid-connect-oidc-via-federate) Configure the elements setting up oidc via federate `npm run cdk deploy CI-Dev -- --parameters devMode=false`
5. Deploy the ci-stack, takes ~10 minutes to deploy
6. Log onto the AWS Console of the account, navigate to [cloud watch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home), open log groups, looking for `JenkinsMainNode/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`
7. Search the logs for `Jenkins initial setup is required. An admin user has been created and a password generated.` After that entry the password for the jenkins instance will be in the cloudwatch logs.
8. Go to the `CI-Dev.JenkinsExternalLoadBalancerDns` url returned by CDK output to access the jenkins host.

### Executing Optional Tasks
#### SSL Configuration
1. Locate the secret manager arns in the ci-config-stack outputs
2. Update the secret value ([see docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-secret-value.html)) for the `certContentsSecret` with the certificate contents
3. Update the secret value ([see docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-secret-value.html)) for the `privateKeySecret` with the certificate private key
4. Upload the certificate to IAM. [See docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/upload-server-certificate.html)
5. Update the secret value for the `certificateArnSecret` with the certificate arn generated by IAM
6. Run with paramenter `npm run cdk deploy CI-Dev -- --parameters useSsl=true`
7. Continue with [next steps](#dev-deployment)

#### setup OpenId Connect (OIDC) via Federate
1. Locate the secret manager arns in the ci-config-stack outputs
2. Update the secret value ([see docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-secret-value.html)) for the `OIDCClientIdSecret` with the credentials as json as follows:
```
{
	"clientId": "example_id",
	"clientPassword": "example_password",
	"wellKnownOpenIDConfigurationUrl": "https://www.example.com"
}
```
3. Run with paramenter `npm run cdk deploy CI-Dev -- --parameters devMode=false`
4. Continue with [next steps](#dev-deployment) 

### Troubleshooting
#### Main Node
Useful links
- Log are found in [Cloud Watch Logs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home)
- Need to access the host, ssh via Session Manager in [EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home)
- Instance instance isn't coming up, get the system log in [EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home)


### Useful commands

- `npm run build`   compile typescript to js, run lint, run tests
- `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
- `npm run cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `npm run cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
- `npm run cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

### Architecture Overview

![Plantuml diagram, see ./diagrams/opensearch-ci-overview.puml for source](./diagrams/opensearch-ci-overview.svg)

Built using [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) the configuration of the CI systems will be available for replication in your own accounts.  The Jenkins instance will be hardened and publically visible, connected to GitHub to make build notifications easy for everyone to see.
