## OpenSearch Continuous Integration

OpenSearch Continuous Integration is an open source CI system for OpenSearch and its plugins.

## Getting Started

- Requires [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install) to be installed
- Install project dependencies using `npm install` from this project directory
- Configure [aws credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites)
- Deploy stacks with `npm run cdk deploy`

## Deployment

### CI Deployment
1. Create another cdk project and depend on this package
2. Import the config / ci stacks alongside the other resources
   ```typescript
   new CIConfigStack(app, 'CI-Config-Beta', {});
   new CIStack(app, 'CI-Beta', ciSettings, {});
   ```
3. Update the `ciSettings` according to the environment needs such as SSL or strict deployment, see [CIStackProps](./lib/ci-stack.ts) for details.
4. Update the `assetsSettings` according to the environment needs such as SSL or strict deployment, see [deployAwsAssetProps](./lib/ci-stack.ts) for details.
5. Deploy using the CI system of your choice.

### Dev Deployment 
1. Setup your local machine to credentials to deploy to the AWS Account
1. Deploy the bootstrap stack by running the following command that sets up required resources to create the stacks. [More info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html)
   
   `npm run cdk bootstrap -- -c useSsl=false -c runWithOidc=false`
   
1. Deploy the ci-config-stack using the following (takes ~1 minute to deploy) - 
   
   `npm run cdk deploy OpenSearch-CI-Config-Dev -- -c useSsl=false -c runWithOidc=false`
   
1. [Optional](#ssl-configuration) Configure the elements of the config stack for SSL configuration
1. [Optional](#setup-openid-connect-oidc-via-federate) Configure the elements setting up oidc via federate
1. Deploy the ci-stack, takes ~10 minutes to deploy (parameter values depend on step 2 and step 3)
   
   `npm run cdk deploy OpenSearch-CI-Dev -- -c useSsl=false -c runWithOidc=false`
 
1. When OIDC is disabled, this set up will enforce the user to secure jenkins by adding first admin user on deployment. Create admin user and password, fill in all other details like name and email id to start using jenkins.
1. Go to the `OpenSearch-CI-Dev.JenkinsExternalLoadBalancerDns` url returned by CDK output to access the jenkins host.
1. If you want to destroy the stack make sure you delete the agent nodes manually (via jenkins UI or AWS console) so that shared resources (like vpc, security groups, etc) can be deleted.

### Executing Optional Tasks
#### SSL Configuration
1. Locate the secret manager arns in the ci-config-stack outputs
1. Update the secret value ([see docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-secret-value.html)) for the `certContentsSecret` with the certificate contents
```
$aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
--secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret_or_ARN \
--secret-string file://mycreds.json_or_value
```
1. Update the secret value ([see docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-secret-value.html)) for the `privateKeySecret` with the certificate private key
1. Upload the certificate to IAM [see docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/upload-server-certificate.html)
1. Update the secret value for the `certificateArnSecret` with the certificate arn generated by IAM
1. Update the secret value for `redirectUrlSecret` with a dummy or valid redirect URL. eg: https://dummyJenkinsUrl.com
1. Run with parameter using one of the following (refer [this](#setup-openid-connect-oidc-via-federate)  for value of `runWithOidc`)
   1. `npm run cdk deploy OpenSearch-CI-Dev -- -c useSsl=true -c runWithOidc=true` or,
   1. `cdk deploy OpenSearch-CI-Dev -c useSsl=true -c runWithOidc=true`
1. Continue with [next steps](#dev-deployment)

#### Setup OpenId Connect (OIDC) via Federate
1. Locate the secret manager arns in the ci-config-stack outputs
1. Update the secret value ([see docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-secret-value.html)) for the `OIDCClientIdSecret` with the credentials as json as follows:
   1. JSON format
   ```
    {
        "clientId": "example_id",
        "clientSecret": "example_password",
        "wellKnownOpenIDConfigurationUrl": "https://www.example.com",
        "tokenServerUrl": "https://example.com/token",
        "authorizationServerUrl": "https://example.com/authorize",
        "userInfoServerUrl": "https://example.com/userinfo"
    }
    ```
   1. Command Eg: [see docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/put-secret-value.html)
   ```
    $aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
    --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret_or_ARN \
    --secret-string file://mycreds.json_or_value
    ```
1. Add additional `adminUsers` for role based authentication according to your needs, see [CIStackProps](./lib/ci-stack.ts) for details.
1. Run with parameter with one of the following (refer [this](#ssl-configuration) for value of `useSsL`) -
   1. `npm run cdk deploy OpenSearch-CI-Dev -- -c runWithOidc=true -c useSsl=true` or,
   1. `cdk deploy OpenSearch-CI-Dev -c runWithOidc=true -c useSsl=true`
1. Continue with [next steps](#dev-deployment)

#### Data Retention
Change in any EC2 config (specially init config) leads to replacement of EC2. The jenkins configuration is managed via code using configuration as code plugin. [More details](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/).
See inital [jenkins.yaml](./resources/baseJenkins.yaml)
If you want to retain all the jobs and its build history, 
1. Update the `dataRetention` property in `ciSettings` to true (defaults to false) see [CIStackProps](./lib/ci-stack.ts) for details.
This will create an EFS (Elastic File System) and mount it on `/var/lib/jenkins` which will retain all jobs and its build history.

#### Add environment variables
Users can add global level environment variables using configuration as code as follows:

Update the `envVarsFilePath` property in `ciSettings` to the *yaml* file path containing all environment variables in the form of key:value pair. See [CIStackProps](./lib/ci-stack.ts) for details.

Example: See [env.txt](./test/data/env.yaml)
```
envVarsFilePath = 'test/data/env.yaml'
```

#### Assume role
The Created jenkins agent role can assume cross account role by passing `agentAssumeRole` parameter
Example:
```
npm run cdk deploy OpenSearch-CI-Dev -- -c useSsl=false -c runWithOidc=false -c agentAssumeRole=arn:aws:iam::522XXX13897:role/sample-assume-role
```
NOTE: The assume role has to be pre-created for the agents to assume. Once CDK stack is deployed with `-c agentAssumeRole` flag, make sure this flag is passed for next CDK operations to make sure this created policy that assumes cross-account role is not removed.

#### Runnning additional commands
In cases where you need to run additional logic/commands, such as adding a cron to emit ssl cert expiry metric, you can pass the commands as a script using `additionalCommands` context parameter.
Below sample will write the python script to $HOME/hello-world path on jenkins master node and then execute it once the jenkins master node has been brought up. 
```
cat << EOF > $HOME/hello-world && chmod 755 $HOME/hello-world && $HOME/hello-world
#!/usr/bin/env python3
def print_hello():
    print("Hello World")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_hello()
EOF
```
To use above example, you need to write the contents of the script to a file, say example.txt and pass the path of example.txt to `additionalCommands` paramter.   
Usage:
```
npm run cdk deploy OpenSearch-CI-Dev -- -c useSsl=false -c runWithOidc=false -c additionalCommands='./example.txt'
```

### Troubleshooting
#### Main Node
Useful links
- Log are found in [Cloud Watch Logs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home)
- Need to access the host, ssh via Session Manager in [EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home)
- Instance instance isn't coming up, get the system log in [EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home)


### Useful commands

- `npm run build`   compile typescript to js, run lint, run tests
- `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
- `npm run cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `npm run cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
- `npm run cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

### Architecture Overview

![Plantuml diagram, see ./diagrams/opensearch-ci-overview.puml for source](./diagrams/opensearch-ci-overview.svg)

Built using [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) the configuration of the CI systems will be available for replication in your own accounts.  The Jenkins instance will be hardened and publically visible, connected to GitHub to make build notifications easy for everyone to see.
